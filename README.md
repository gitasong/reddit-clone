## Epicodus Final Weeks Planning

How I will spend my eight hours today:

As I have a doctor’s appointment mid-day, this work will be spread out over the weekend. Also, as I’ve fallen behind due to health problems, I’m going to use the weekend to play catch-up and complete at least one React-Redux project from the week. (Thanks for the opportunity to play catch-up, btw!)

Work I’d like to prioritize in the weeks to come: 1) Solidifying my understanding of React/Redux, 2) learning React Native/studying mobile app design (as I’d like my capstone to be a mobile app), and in general, 3) studying larger-scale app architecture (since I may be working on enterprise-level apps at some point) and filling in the gaps between the small-scale algorithmic problems we worked on in Intro and the large-scale architectural designs of the frameworks we’ve been working on in Units 2 and 3. I feel that there are a lot of leaps in logic and general gaps in the curriculum moving between these two.

Technical questions for further exploration: I would like to: a) re-acquaint myself with vanilla JavaScript, SANS frameworks (since I feel like I’ve forgotten it :), and b) possibly use it to build some of the apps we’ve built in Angular, React, etc. so that I can see and understand the transition between the various technologies and architectural levels. I would also like to: c) revisit the basics of OOP (especially the “this” variable!) as well as things like callbacks and higher-order functions and some of the newer ES6 syntax (e.g. fat arrow syntax, restructuring) that I never really understood fully. d) I also may want to look into app deployment, since at some point, I hope to sell my own apps.
